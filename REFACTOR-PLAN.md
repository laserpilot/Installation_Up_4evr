# Installation Up 4evr - v1.0.0 Major Refactor Plan

## Version Strategy
- **v0.9.0-foundation** (2025_updates branch): Current stable implementation with all monitoring fixes
- **v1.0.0-alpha.1** (this branch): Major architectural refactor

## Current Foundation (v0.9.0-foundation)
The foundation version includes:
- Complete monitoring dashboard with accurate system metrics
- Smart Launch Agents categorization and filtering
- App health scoring with 0-100 ratings and historical data
- Enhanced network status with IP display
- Fixed display detection for MacBook built-in displays
- Scheduled reboot functionality
- Detailed issue descriptions for warnings/alerts
- Manual refresh capabilities for system status
- Comprehensive UI/UX improvements

## Proposed Refactor Goals (v1.0.0)
*To be defined based on your architectural vision*

### Areas for Discussion:
1. **Frontend Framework**: Move from vanilla JS to React/Vue/Svelte?
2. **Backend Architecture**: Modularize further, add proper API versioning?
3. **Database Layer**: Add persistent storage for configurations/history?
4. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom monitoring modules?
5. **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with validation?
6. **Testing Strategy**: Add comprehensive test coverage?
7. **Deployment**: Docker containerization, proper packaging?
8. **API Design**: RESTful improvements, OpenAPI spec?

### Questions for Planning:
- What are the main architectural pain points you want to address?
- What new features or capabilities do you envision for v1.0?
- Are there performance, scalability, or maintainability concerns?
- Should we maintain backward compatibility with current configs?

## Next Steps
1. Define refactor scope and priorities
2. Create architectural diagrams for new design
3. Plan migration strategy from v0.9.0 foundation
4. Implement iteratively with alpha releases

# Launch Agents Module Tracker

**Module:** Launch Agents Management  
**Files:** `frontend/js/modules/launch-agents.js`, `frontend/js/components/LaunchAgentCard.js`, `backend/src/platform/macos/process-manager.js`  
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-05  
**Status:** âœ… Fully Functional

---

## Current Status âœ…

**âœ… All Core Functionality Working:**
- Desktop application launch agents (.app files)
- Web application launch agents (Chrome kiosk mode)
- Real-time status monitoring (5-second refresh)
- Complete lifecycle management (create/install/uninstall/test)
- Drag-and-drop interface for .app files
- URL input and validation for web applications

**âœ… Recently Fixed (Phase 9.1):**
- Fixed "No user launch agents found" error
- Added missing `extractWebAppInfo` method in backend
- Simplified filtering logic to show only user directory agents
- All 14 user launch agents from `~/Library/LaunchAgents` now display correctly

## Active Issues ðŸŽ¯

**Currently:** 
- [ ] Clicking Web Applications button does not work or change anything on the page, so I am unable to test if this is actually working
- [ ] Buttons under each launch agent are currently displaying vertically instead of horizontally
- [ ] div.agent-filters - not sure if this is still a necessary area, and the buttons also do not work
- [ ] Is there a way we can clearly indicate which launch agents are created by our tool vs something else? if someone adds a launch agent here, i would expect it to also show up in the "Application Status" section of the dashboard.

## Potential Improvements ðŸ’¡

- [ ] **Enhanced Web App Support** - Additional browser options beyond Chrome
- [ ] **Batch Operations** - Select multiple agents for bulk enable/disable
- [ ] **Import/Export** - Launch agent profile sharing between installations
- [ ] **Scheduling** - Time-based launch agent activation
- [ ] **Dependency Management** - Agent startup order and dependencies

## Common Issues & Solutions

### **Fixed Issues:**
1. **"No user launch agents found"** *(Resolved 2025-07-05)*
   - **Cause:** Missing `extractWebAppInfo` method in backend
   - **Solution:** Added complete method to MacOSProcessManager class
   - **Files:** `backend/src/platform/macos/process-manager.js`

2. **Complex filtering logic** *(Resolved 2025-07-05)*
   - **Cause:** Overly complex filter excluding user agents
   - **Solution:** Simplified to check user directory paths explicitly
   - **Files:** `frontend/js/modules/launch-agents.js`

### **Troubleshooting Guide:**
- **Empty agent list:** Check `ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents` has files
- **Status not updating:** Verify real-time updates are enabled in tab
- **Web app creation fails:** Check URL format and network connectivity
- **Load/unload not working:** Verify permissions and file existence

## Future Development Ideas

### **Enhancement Opportunities:**
1. **Multi-Browser Support** - Safari, Firefox, Edge kiosk modes
2. **Advanced Scheduling** - Conditional startup based on time/system state
3. **Template System** - Pre-built templates for common creative applications
4. **Backup/Restore** - Agent configuration backup and restoration
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Track agent resource usage and impact

### **Platform Expansion:**
- Windows Service integration for cross-platform support
- Linux systemd service management
- Container/Docker deployment options

## Development Notes

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean separation between frontend UI and backend logic
- Real-time status updates provide excellent user feedback
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Professional UI matches overall application design

**Performance Considerations:**
- 5-second refresh interval balances responsiveness with system load
- Efficient filtering and rendering for large agent lists
- Lazy loading of agent details for better performance

**Security Features:**
- Validation of URLs and file paths
- Safe file operations with proper error handling
- User confirmation for destructive actions (delete)

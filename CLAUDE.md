# Claude Context for Installation Up 4evr Automation Tool

## Project Overview
Building an automation tool to simplify Mac installation setup for creative technology installations. The tool will automate system preference changes, create launch agents, provide monitoring/logging dashboards, and health check scripts with a simple GUI interface.

## Architecture Decision
- **Platform**: Web app (local server + browser interface)
- **Backend**: Node.js with shell script integration
- **Frontend**: Modern web framework (React/Vue.js)
- **Structure**: Modular design for easy maintenance

## Current Status - COMPLETE ✅
- ✅ Analyzed existing README.md and shell scripts
- ✅ Designed modular tool architecture  
- ✅ Created system preferences automation module (12 settings)
- ✅ Built launch agent generator and manager (full lifecycle)
- ✅ Created installation profiles system (5 built-in templates)
- ✅ Built comprehensive monitoring system (CPU, memory, disk, apps, displays)
- ✅ Added remote control interface (10+ commands)
- ✅ Implemented multi-channel notification system (Slack, Discord, webhooks)
- ✅ Created persistent logging with file storage
- ✅ Built heartbeat system for uptime monitoring
- ✅ Created web server with 50+ API endpoints
- ✅ Built complete frontend with drag-and-drop interface
- ✅ Packaged as Electron app for native distribution
- ✅ Written comprehensive documentation
- ✅ All modules tested and working
- ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub (2025_updates branch)

## Key Requirements
- Automate all system preference changes from the README checklist
- Generate and manage launch agents 
- Monitoring dashboard with health checks
- Logging and notification system (Slack integration)
- Simple GUI interface
- Modular design for easy extension

## Important Notes
- All existing scripts are defensive/monitoring utilities (verified safe)
- Focus on 2025 updates mentioned in README (Apple Silicon, SIP, signing requirements)
- Must handle modern macOS security restrictions
- Target audience: creative technologists setting up installation computers

## Test Commands
- `cd backend && npm start` - Start web server
- `cd backend && npm test` - Run test suite  
- `cd backend && npm run test:system-prefs` - Test system preferences
- `cd backend && npm run test:launch-agents` - Test launch agents
- Open http://localhost:3001 in browser - Access web interface
